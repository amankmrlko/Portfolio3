          <p>
            My journey into web development started with a deep curiosity about
            how the digital world works and a strong desire to create seamless
            and engaging user experiences. With a B.Tech degree and a hands-on
            approach to learning, I have turned that curiosity into a career by
            bringing ideas to life through responsive, accessible, and scalable
            interfaces using tools like React.js, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS.
          </p>

            At Tata Consultancy Services, I have contributed to building high
            performance web solutions, working on everything from front-end
            development to debugging live production issues. I take pride in
            writing clean and efficient code, and in creating user interfaces
            that are both visually appealing and functionally solid.
            <p>
              <br />
              <p>
                For me, good design is not just about how it looks but how it
                works and how it feels. I aim to make sure every project I work
                on delivers a clear and thoughtful user experience.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Outside of work, I am passionate about music. I play the guitar
                and enjoy producing music in my free time. I also love playing
                chess, which helps me stay sharp and focused, and I spend a lot
                of time reading both fiction and nonfiction to keep my mind
                inspired.
              </p>

            </p>
            Working with me means collaborating with someone who values
            creativity, precision, and digital craftsmanship. I am always ready
            to take on new challenges and excited to build something
            exceptional.
